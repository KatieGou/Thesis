# Thesis: Image Text Relation Degree Project

Master's Thesis Project at KTH Royal Institute of Technology and InooLabs.

## Introduction
Image-Text Relation Degree Project aims to predict the relation between an image and a piece of text (whether the text describes the image) in Swedish context. The project used BERT as backbones, and the model was trained on MS-COCO dataset.

The BERT models can be downloaded from [here](https://huggingface.co/models). The image feature extraction used [this](https://github.com/airsplay/py-bottom-up-attention) repository. The models used to extract features can be found [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2/blob/main/MODEL_ZOO.md).
